<a name="how_enrol" id="how_enrol"></a>How do I enrol?</b></p><p>You have two options to enrol.</p><p><i>First option:</i> You can continue to enrol directly after the payment process by clicking the Start Now option on the page.&nbsp; You will be taken to the Student registration page, where you will need to click on the Begin Registration button to setup your student account. You will then have to input your personal information in the 6 step registration process.&nbsp; This is the quickest way to get started on your Training straight away</p><p>Please remember the details you enter when you create your Student account will need to be correct in content and spelling to ensure no unnecessary delays in the issuing of your RSA Certificate.</p><p><i>Second option:</i> If you would like to register your account and enrol at a later time, you will receive a confirmation email after you have purchased your course.&nbsp; This email will contain your enrolment code.&nbsp; If you cannot find this email, check your spam or junk email folder. If you click on the enrolment code in that email, you will be taken to the Student registration page, where you will need to click on the Begin Registration button. You will then have to input your personal information in the 6 step registration process to get started with your training</p><p><b>
<a name="pass_course" id="pass_course"></a>Is it possible to fail the course?</b></p><p>When you are completing your Online RSA training, you will have 3 attempts per question.</p><p>If you exceed your allotted 3 attempts on a question you will be locked out of your course. This lockout system is implemented to ensure that students who are having difficulty answering questions or understanding the course materials,&nbsp;&nbsp; take the time to re-read the relevant training material&nbsp; and receive&nbsp; assistance when required.</p><p>To have your account unlocked, please submit a ticket with a request to have your account unlocked. Please note that your request can only be processed Monday - Friday between the hours of 9 AM to 5 PM.</p><p>If you then incorrectly answer the same question another 3 times we will organise to have your details referred to a trainer who can give assistance in understanding the Training Material. Please note that it may take up to 2 business days for a trainer to contact you about your course. However there is NO additional fee charged for this service.</p><p>When answering questions, please ensure that you enter the correct number of responses; if the question is asking you for 3 responses, you must submit at least 3 responses or your answer will be marked as being incorrect by the marking team.</p><p>If you finding difficulty in completing the questions due to having difficulty understanding the material or content, we can provide access to fully qualified trainers to assist.</p><p><b>
<a name="rsa_under_18" id="rsa_under_18"></a>Can under 18s do the training?</b></p><p>Yes. Anyone can do their RSA online, but this does not mean that you will be able to serve liquor if you are under the age of 18. &nbsp;It is a great qualification to have if you want to work in the hospitality industry and employers would see this as an advantage in hiring you. So definitely make sure you add it to your resume, when you have received your certificate.</p><p>Please contact your State/Territory to find out more about serving requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>
<a name="rsa_usi" id="rsa_usi"></a>Do I need a Unique Student Identifier (USI)?</b></p><p>Yes. From the 1st of January 2015 everyone undertaking nationally recognised training in Australia must have a unique student identifier.</p><p>During our course enrolment process you will be asked to provide a USI.</p><p>In rare circumstances you may need to speak directly with the <a href="https://www.usi.gov.au/" title="rsa usi" target="_blank">government USI Department</a> to provide further details. We will notify you if this is the case.&nbsp;</p><p>The following video explains USI.</p><div class="video-container" style="position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;padding-top:30px;height:0;overflow:hidden;">

</div><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>
<a name="rsa_in_australia" id="rsa_in_australia"></a>Do I need to be in Australia to complete the course?</b></p><p>As long as you are not on a student 500 Visa you can start the course but you can not complete it until you arrive in Australia and have an Australian postal address and apply for a Unique Student Identifier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you are travelling on a student 500 Visa you can not do online RSA training with us or any other provider. Australia has different laws in every state so you need to check the requirements to ensure you have the correct training for the area you are planning on working in. Everyone studying nationally&nbsp;recognised&nbsp;training in Australia is required by the Australian government to have a Unique Student Identifier (USI). This has been mandatory since 1/1/2015.&nbsp;The USI Office has determined that International Students will not be able to create a USI until they enter Australia and their passport has been registered with the Australian Government.&nbsp; &nbsp;Once you have arrived in Australia and your passport has been processed, then you should be able to complete the application form for the USI on the government website link below. You will need to select the 'Australian Visa' category to proceed. Note people travelling on student 500 visa can not do online RSA training in Australia.&nbsp;</p><p><b>
<a name="visa500" id="visa500"></a>Can Students on a SubClass 500 Visa do online RSA training?</b></p><p>No.</p><p>We are sorry but students who are in Australia, or coming to Australia, on a subclass 500 student visa are only permitted to study nationally recognised training courses with a training provider that is registered with CRICOS. However, CRICOS registered training providers are not permitted to deliver a single unit course 100% online.&nbsp;</p><p>Please direct any enquiries or register your complaints via the ASQA Info Line. For details, please follow <a href="http://cricos.education.gov.au/Contacts/CRICOSContacts.aspx?ContactID=20815" target="_blank">this link</a>:</p><p><b>
<a name="time_to_complete_rsa" id="time_to_complete_rsa"></a>How long does it take to complete the course?</b></p><p>The course is set up in different subject sections with an online assessment after each section. You can come and go as often as you please; the system will save your progress.</p><p>However, if you want to do it in one session, most people take about 6-8 hours (but this will depend on your experience, internet speed, literacy and other factors). &nbsp;There is up to 50 hours of additional supporting documentation.&nbsp;</p><p>We like you to complete your course fully within a month of purchase and you will find it easier if you put in the effort to complete the training while the information is fresh in your mind.</p><p><b>
<a name="reattempt_questions_or_quizes" id="reattempt_questions_or_quizes"></a>How do I reattempt Questions or Quizzes? How many times can I reattempt questions?</b></p><p>For the ACT, QLD, WA, SA, NT, NSW and TAS course:</p><p>You can immediately retry a Quiz if you did not pass the Quiz.</p><p>You can reattempt each Quiz three times for the; ACT, QLD, WA, SA, NT, NSW and TAS course. If you exceed the maximum attempts on a Quiz, you will need to contact our support team via email or phone. We can refer your details to a trainer who can assist you with any questions that are causing difficulty. There is no fee incurred if you need to speak to a trainer; it is part of the service!</p><p><b>
<a name="come_and_go" id="come_and_go"></a></b><b>Can I come and go as often as I like and will the system remember where I am up to?</b></p><p>Yes. Simply make sure when you want to exit you do so by closing the screen using the X button in the top right corner of the screen, or click the Return to the Main Menu link. The next time you log in the system will ask &quot;Do you want to start where you left off?&quot; and you should answer yes.</p><p><b>
<a name="time_to_complete" id="time_to_complete"></a>How long do I have to complete the training?</b></p><p>You have four weeks to complete the training after which we reserve the right to cancel your training. You can work on your course at any time of the day or night, and it is not necessary that you complete the training in one sitting. You can save your progress and come back to your course at a later time. You do not need to complete your course the same day you start it.</p><p><b>
<a name="as_good_as_in_class_training" id="as_good_as_in_class_training"></a>Is online training as good as in class training?</b></p><p>Yes and in some cases like this, online is better. In class training means you have to learn at the rate of the slowest students.&nbsp; Online training is interactive, and allows students to spend more time on the areas that they find the most challenging.</p><p><b>
<a name="review_content_before_quiz" id="review_content_before_quiz"></a>Can I review the content of a section again before taking the quiz?</b></p><p>Yes. You can return to your main menu and review the section materials if you need to refresh your memory.</p><p><b>
<a name="change_spelling_rsa" id="change_spelling_rsa"></a>I made a typo when spelling my name or putting in other details; can I change it?</b></p><p>No. You will need to call or email support with your account details, identify yourself and then our support staff will be able to make the necessary changes to your account. Alternatively, you can log into your student portal and submit a change of details electronic form.</p><p><b>
<a name="practical_demonstration_rsa" id="practical_demonstration_rsa"></a>What about practical Demonstration of skills?</b></p><p>We have a couple of interactive exercises within the Online training course which will help you understand the Training material better and put your new knowledge into practice.</p><p>
<a name="rsafast" id="rsafast"></a><b>What is the fastest way to get my Certificate?</b></p><p>Most people are in a hurry to get their RSA certificate and start their new job.&nbsp; The fastest way to get your certificate&nbsp; is to submit all of your identity documents at the start and&nbsp; make sure you read the learning material and get the questions right and do not guess the answers.&nbsp; If you get an answer incorrect 3x you will have to speak with a trainer during business hours and this may slow you down.&nbsp; Also if you do get an answer wrong, avoid trying that answer again, as that will be counted as another attempt.&nbsp;</p>            </div>
